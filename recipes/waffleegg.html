        Youâ€™ll love the sweet and savory flavors in this easy, all-in-one breakfast. This fun twist on classic egg-in-a-hole is air fried for easy cooking and clean-up. Plus, the frozen waffle cut-out serves as the cutest dipper for scooping up the soft egg. Personalize it with your breakfast favorites, like shredded Parmesan, bacon bits, or even hot sauce.

    <ul>
        <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
        <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
